# Schems
Schematics for Mindustry's planet Serpulo.

Most schemes pulled from YouTube video [MINDUSTRY Serpulo - List of Schematics for v7](https://youtu.be/6pNt8toa4Wo) by MindustryJP.

5-kiln metaglass scheme is from GitHub repo [SchematicsPack](https://github.com/pixecoz/SchematicsPack) by pixecoz.

I have done all the turret schemes and drill schemes.

Feel free to use them. They're designed for use with schematics browsers.
